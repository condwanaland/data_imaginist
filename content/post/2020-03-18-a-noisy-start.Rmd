I was sure I had released this... Honestly, I thought the new version of ambient
had landed on CRAN a year ago. What does that say about me as a developer? 
Probably not something very positive. One reason is probably that ambient is one
of my smaller packages mostly made for myself. It generates noise patterns which
is something I use extensively in my 
[generative art](https://www.data-imaginist.com/art). And the version of ambient
I'm now announcing has been available on my own computer for a long time, so I 
haven't noticed the lack of a real CRAN release.

## What is noise
Anyway, what is this package really about? It is a package that facilitates the
generation of multidimensional noise of different kinds. Noise should not be 
equated with completely random values, R has extensive support for generating
these through the different distribution sampling functions. The noise that
ambient is capable of producing are random, but spatially correlated noise 
patterns... what on earth is that? Let's have a look!

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ambient)
library(dplyr)

image(noise_perlin(dim = c(300, 400)))
```

We see in the above example that the pattern is sort of random, but it remains
structured so the value at each point is highly correlated to its neighbors.
While we have looked at a 2D example, this principle can be expanded to 3 or 
even 4 dimensions.

The example above used the old interface which is already available on CRAN. 
That interface simply returns matrices or arrays with the x and y (and z and t) 
values corresponding to the indices of each cell. This is fast, but super 
limiting, and the new and promoted interface that you'll see in a second adds 
much more control and power.

## A new API
The limitation of the old API was mainly that you were bound to only retrieve
values at integer coordinates. This in turn limited the amount of weird 
operations you might want to do to the coordinates before using them to 
calculate a noise value. Further, it simply felt clunky and didn't fit in very
well with any type of function composition.

The new API (the old still exists) is centered around a long-format grid 
representation that you create with `long_grid()`. It basically creates an 
adorned data frame with coordinates for each row, but provides additional 
functionality for converting back to matrix/arrays and raster object:

```{r}
grid <- long_grid(x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000),
                  y = seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000))

grid
```

You can create higher dimensions by simply providing `z` and `t` arguments to 
`long_grid()` as well. This is all kind of boring of course since we haven't 
added any noise yet (which is kinda the point of all this). Don't worry - it 
will come.

## The generators
There are many different types of noise that can be generated with ambient. 
Perlin noise is perhaps the most well-known (it did land the creator an Oscar
after all), but many other exists with different characteristics. All of these
can be sampled with the new family of `gen_*()` functions (generator functions).
These all take coordinates along with different other arguments such as e.g.
`frequency` and `seed`. As an example lets calculate some worley noise:

```{r}
grid <- grid %>% 
  mutate(
    noise = gen_worley(x, y, frequency = 5, value = 'distance')
  )
grid
```

We have now created a new column with the respective worley noise value for each
cell. It is usually easier to understand by looking at it:

```{r}
grid %>% 
  plot(noise)
```

We see that the `as.raster()` method takes an expression that defines what value
should be used for the raster. We normalize it so that it lies between 0 and 1 
(a requirement of the raster class) and then use the plot method provided for 
the raster class.

There are a bunch of these `gen_*()` functions. Further, there are also a bunch
of `gen_*()` functions for creating non-noise patterns, e.g.

```{r}
grid %>% 
  mutate(
    pattern = gen_waves(x, y, frequency = 5)
  ) %>%  
  plot(pattern)
```

You may feel at this point that the old interface was much nicer, but the great
thing about the generators is that they don't care about whether the coordinates
you feed into it lie in a grid. This means that they can be used to directly look 
up noise values for particles in a simulation, or modify the grid coordinates 
before they are passed into the generator. The latter is what is known as noise
perturbation and was only available in a very limited form in the old API.

```{r}
grid %>% 
  mutate(
    pertube = gen_simplex(x, y, frequency = 5) / 10,
    noise = gen_worley(x + pertube, y + pertube, value = 'distance', frequency = 5)
  ) %>% 
  plot(noise)
```

Funky, right? Just to explain what is really going on, each cell in the grid 
gets a simplex based value, which it then uses to offset its own coordinates 
before looking up its worley noise value. As simplex noise has a smooth gradient
we get these waves distortions of the worley noise.

## Fractured noise
The output of e.g. `gen_perlin()` does not look like what you'd expect if you
are used to working with perlin noise (I'd guess). This is because perlin noise
is most often used in its fractal form. Fractal noise simply means calculating 
multiple values for each coordinates at different frequencies and somehow 
combining them. The most well known is *fractal brownian motion* (fbm) that 
simply adds each value together with decreasing intensity, but any combination
scheme is possible and ambient comes with a few. To create fractal noise with 
the new interface we use the `fracture()` method and pass in a generator and a
fractal function along with the different arguments to it:

```{r}
# Classic perlin noise (combining 4 different frequencies)
grid %>% 
  mutate(
    noise = fracture(gen_perlin, fbm, octaves = 4, x = x, y = y, freq_init = 5)
  ) %>% 
  plot(noise)
```

ambient comes with a handful of different fractal function and you can create 
your own as well

```{r}
# clamp noise before adding them together
grid %>% 
  mutate(
    noise = fracture(gen_perlin, clamped, octaves = 4, x = x, y = y, freq_init = 5)
  ) %>% 
  plot(noise)
```

* * *

There are a few other functions as part of this release for e.g. blending 
values together and calculating derived values from noise fields (e.g. curl and
gradient). I will let it be up to you to explore these at your own accord.
