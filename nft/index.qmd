I've explored various aspects of crypto-art, starting in the spring of 2021. Only art minted by the following addresses is by me, unless otherwise specified below:

#### Tezos

-   [tz2Pkj2xWJovKKCsABjnr3NbyMVJTMBkpTvb](https://tzkt.io/tz2Pkj2xWJovKKCsABjnr3NbyMVJTMBkpTvb/) (thomasp85.tez)

#### Ethereum

-   [0xa0c34acdeda216ee5424544fc885d7dafca3c54c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0c34acdeda216ee5424544fc885d7dafca3c54c) (thomasp85.eth)
-   [0x5a77b2d05afb67eacd8f9c7e98692dd1e2883cb3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a77b2d05afb67eacd8f9c7e98692dd1e2883cb3) (vault.thomasp85.eth)

## Projects

### Hic et Nunc

HEN was the first place I began minting and will always have a special place in my heart. While the site is no longer active, it was build on an open source foundation and the mints are kept alive on mirror sites as well as markets that support the OBJKT token, such as [OBJKT.com](https://objkt.com/profile/thomasp85/created). If you want to explore my mints in it's original old school brutalist interface you can look at [hicetnunc.art](https://hicetnunc.art/Thomas_Lin_Pedersen).

### Versum

My default place for minting 1/1s on Tezos is now [Versum](https://versum.xyz/user/thomasp85), a relatively new platform build by some of the same developers that helped HEN in the early days and who have a great vision for an inclusive and healthy NFT community.

### Foundation

I am minting single edition pieces on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/@thomasp85) from time to time. The collection is smaller and I'll usually split my work between this and minting on Tezos.

### ArtBlocks

I'm creating long-form generative art on [ArtBlocks](https://www.artblocks.io/user/0x5a77b2d05afb67eacd8f9c7e98692dd1e2883cb3) where the artwork is fully on-chain. So far I've created:

-   [Rapture](https://www.artblocks.io/project/141) ([read more](https://data-imaginist.com/rapture))
-   [Screens](https://www.artblocks.io/project/255) ([read more](https://data-imaginist.com/screens))
