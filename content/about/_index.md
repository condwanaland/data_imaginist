I'm a former bioinformatician/computational biologist turned data scientist 
turned software engineer who focuses on improving researchers interactions with 
the data they produce. I'm part of the tidyverse team at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)
where I focus on improving the performance of graphic rendering in R as well as
taking part in maintaining ggplot2 and related packages

I'm on twitter ([@thomasp85](https://twitter.com/thomasp85)) and 
[GitHub](https://github.com/thomasp85) mainly, though you can also reach me on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasp85).

doing what I do, you can support me through
