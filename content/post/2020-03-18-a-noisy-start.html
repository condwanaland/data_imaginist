<p>I was sure I had released thisâ€¦ Honestly, I thought the new version of ambient
had landed on CRAN a year ago. What does that say about me as a developer?
Probably not something very positive. One reason is probably that ambient is one
of my smaller packages mostly made for myself. It generates noise patterns which
is something I use extensively in my
<a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/art">generative art</a>. And the version of ambient
Iâ€™m now announcing has been available on my own computer for a long time, so I
havenâ€™t noticed the lack of a real CRAN release.</p>
<div id="what-is-noise" class="section level2">
<h2>What is noise</h2>
<p>Anyway, what is this package really about? It is a package that facilitates the
generation of multidimensional noise of different kinds. Noise should not be
equated with completely random values, R has extensive support for generating
these through the different distribution sampling functions. The noise that
ambient is capable of producing are random, but spatially correlated noise
patternsâ€¦ what on earth is that? Letâ€™s have a look!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ambient)
library(dplyr)

image(noise_perlin(dim = c(300, 400)))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-18-a-noisy-start_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We see in the above example that the pattern is sort of random, but it remains
structured so the value at each point is highly correlated to its neighbors.
While we have looked at a 2D example, this principle can be expanded to 3 or
even 4 dimensions.</p>
<p>The example above used the old interface which is already available on CRAN.
That interface simply returns matrices or arrays with the x and y (and z and t)
values corresponding to the indices of each cell. This is fast, but super
limiting, and the new and promoted interface that youâ€™ll see in a second adds
much more control and power.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-new-api" class="section level2">
<h2>A new API</h2>
<p>The limitation of the old API was mainly that you were bound to only retrieve
values at integer coordinates. This in turn limited the amount of weird
operations you might want to do to the coordinates before using them to
calculate a noise value. Further, it simply felt clunky and didnâ€™t fit in very
well with any type of function composition.</p>
<p>The new API (the old still exists) is centered around a long-format grid
representation that you create with <code>long_grid()</code>. It basically creates an
adorned data frame with coordinates for each row, but provides additional
functionality for converting back to matrix/arrays and raster object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grid &lt;- long_grid(x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000),
                  y = seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000))

grid</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,000,000 x 2
##        x       y
##    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1     0 0      
##  2     0 0.00100
##  3     0 0.00200
##  4     0 0.00300
##  5     0 0.00400
##  6     0 0.00501
##  7     0 0.00601
##  8     0 0.00701
##  9     0 0.00801
## 10     0 0.00901
## # â€¦ with 999,990 more rows</code></pre>
<p>You can create higher dimensions by simply providing <code>z</code> and <code>t</code> arguments to
<code>long_grid()</code> as well. This is all kind of boring of course since we havenâ€™t
added any noise yet (which is kinda the point of all this). Donâ€™t worry - it
will come.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-generators" class="section level2">
<h2>The generators</h2>
<p>There are many different types of noise that can be generated with ambient.
Perlin noise is perhaps the most well-known (it did land the creator an Oscar
after all), but many other exists with different characteristics. All of these
can be sampled with the new family of <code>gen_*()</code> functions (generator functions).
These all take coordinates along with different other arguments such as e.g.
<code>frequency</code> and <code>seed</code>. As an example lets calculate some worley noise:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grid &lt;- grid %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    noise = gen_worley(x, y, frequency = 5, value = &#39;distance&#39;)
  )
grid</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,000,000 x 3
##        x       y noise
##    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1     0 0       0.203
##  2     0 0.00100 0.207
##  3     0 0.00200 0.211
##  4     0 0.00300 0.215
##  5     0 0.00400 0.219
##  6     0 0.00501 0.223
##  7     0 0.00601 0.228
##  8     0 0.00701 0.232
##  9     0 0.00801 0.236
## 10     0 0.00901 0.241
## # â€¦ with 999,990 more rows</code></pre>
<p>We have now created a new column with the respective worley noise value for each
cell. It is usually easier to understand by looking at it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grid %&gt;% 
  plot(noise)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-18-a-noisy-start_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We see that the <code>as.raster()</code> method takes an expression that defines what value
should be used for the raster. We normalize it so that it lies between 0 and 1
(a requirement of the raster class) and then use the plot method provided for
the raster class.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of these <code>gen_*()</code> functions. Further, there are also a bunch
of <code>gen_*()</code> functions for creating non-noise patterns, e.g.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grid %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    pattern = gen_waves(x, y, frequency = 5)
  ) %&gt;%  
  plot(pattern)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-18-a-noisy-start_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>You may feel at this point that the old interface was much nicer, but the great
thing about the generators is that they donâ€™t care about whether the coordinates
you feed into it lie in a grid. This means that they can be used to directly look
up noise values for particles in a simulation, or modify the grid coordinates
before they are passed into the generator. The latter is what is known as noise
perturbation and was only available in a very limited form in the old API.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grid %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    pertube = gen_simplex(x, y, frequency = 5) / 10,
    noise = gen_worley(x + pertube, y + pertube, value = &#39;distance&#39;, frequency = 5)
  ) %&gt;% 
  plot(noise)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-18-a-noisy-start_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Funky, right? Just to explain what is really going on, each cell in the grid
gets a simplex based value, which it then uses to offset its own coordinates
before looking up its worley noise value. As simplex noise has a smooth gradient
we get these waves distortions of the worley noise.</p>
</div>
<div id="fractured-noise" class="section level2">
<h2>Fractured noise</h2>
<p>The output of e.g. <code>gen_perlin()</code> does not look like what youâ€™d expect if you
are used to working with perlin noise (Iâ€™d guess). This is because perlin noise
is most often used in its fractal form. Fractal noise simply means calculating
multiple values for each coordinates at different frequencies and somehow
combining them. The most well known is <em>fractal brownian motion</em> (fbm) that
simply adds each value together with decreasing intensity, but any combination
scheme is possible and ambient comes with a few. To create fractal noise with
the new interface we use the <code>fracture()</code> method and pass in a generator and a
fractal function along with the different arguments to it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Classic perlin noise (combining 4 different frequencies)
grid %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    noise = fracture(gen_perlin, fbm, octaves = 4, x = x, y = y, freq_init = 5)
  ) %&gt;% 
  plot(noise)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-18-a-noisy-start_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>ambient comes with a handful of different fractal function and you can create
your own as well</p>
<pre class="r"><code># clamp noise before adding them together
grid %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    noise = fracture(gen_perlin, clamped, octaves = 4, x = x, y = y, freq_init = 5)
  ) %&gt;% 
  plot(noise)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-18-a-noisy-start_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<hr />
<p>There are a few other functions as part of this release for e.g.Â blending
values together and calculating derived values from noise fields (e.g.Â curl and
gradient). I will let it be up to you to explore these at your own accord.</p>
