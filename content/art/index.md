## On generative art
I'm a generative artist focusing mainly on exploring the beauty of dynamic 
systems. For me, the sweet spot of generative art lies in creating a system that
you know well enough to set it up for success, but is so complex that you still
get surprised when you see the result. The more I become familiar with a system
I've developed, the more it feels like a (slightly unpredictable) brush to paint
with.

The process of generative art is dual, in that it both requires the development
of a system, as well as development of a visualisation method for the output of
the system. A single system can give rise to very heterogeneous results if 
different visualisation approaches are employed. Mixing and matching existing 
systems and visualisation methods as well as developing new ones over time is
the cornerstone of making generative art.

All my systems and visualisations are programmed in 
[R](https://cran.r-project.org), an open source programming language for 
statistics and data analysis. I've developed and released many tools that are 
central to my work, and help maintain others. Some of the packages I use most
often are [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), 
[ggforce](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com), 
[ambient](https://ambient.data-imaginist.com),
[particles](https://github.com/thomasp85/particles), 
[tidygraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph), and
[ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com). I do not share the code I use to
create my pieces. The main reason for this is that I don't think it would be
beneficial to anyone. People interested in getting started with generative art
would become to focused on my ideas instead of developing their own. Knowing the
answer is the killer of creativity.
