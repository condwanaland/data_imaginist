## Background
Screens is the continuation of an idea and vision that started with my 
Constructive series (released in August 2021). The primal aim was to explore the 
aesthetics offered by screen printing techniques, and this naturally led me to
explore the poster prints from both Bauhaus artists and Russian constructivism 
artists. Thus, while working on Constructive, the focal points where strong 
geometric compositions, strong simple colour palettes, gradients using a 
rendering technique mimicking screen printing.

Constructive was very much a handheld series. While it is generative in nature,
the macro composition was decided beforehand. I did enjoy the result immensely
and I knew almost immediately that I wanted to explore this aesthetic in a long
form format. Thus began the thought process that led to Screens.

With Screens I wanted to continue my main focus: Strong geometric shapes, 
Gradients,
