I'm happy to once again announce the release of a package. This time it happens
to be a rather unplanned and quick new package, which is fun for a change. The
package in question is `scico` which provides access to the 
[colour palettes developed by Fabio Crameri](http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php) 
as well as scale functions for `ggplot2` so they can be used there. As there is
not a lot to talk about in such a simple package I'll also spend some time 
discussing why choice of colour is important beyond aesthtic considerations, and
discuss how the quality of a palette might be assesed.

## An overview of the package
`scico` provides a total of 17 different continuous palettes, all of which are
available with the `scico()` function. For anyone having used `viridis()` the
`scico()` API is very familiar:

```{r}
library(scico)
scico(15, palette = 'oslo')
```

In order to get a quick overview of all the available palettes use the 
`scico_palette_show()` function:

```{r}
scico_palette_show()
```

As can be seen, the collection consists of both sequential and diverging 
palettes, both of which have their own uses depending on the data you want to 
show. A special mention goes to the `oleron` palette which is intended for 
topographical height data in order to produce the well known *atlas look*. Be 
sure to center this palette around 0 or else you will end up with very 
misleading maps.

`ggplot2` support is provided with the `scale_[colour|color|fill]_scico()` 
functions, which works as expected:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
volcano <- data.frame(
  x = rep(seq_len(ncol(volcano)), each = nrow(volcano)),
  y = rep(seq_len(nrow(volcano)), ncol(volcano)),
  Altitude = as.vector(volcano)
)

ggplot(volcano, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = Altitude)) + 
  geom_raster() + 
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_scico(palette = 'turku') 
```

This is more or less all there is for this package... Now, let's get to the meat 
of the discussion.

## What's in a colour?
If you've ever wondered why we are not all just using rainbow colours in our 
plots (after all, rainbows *are* pretty...) it's because our choice of colour 
scale have a deep impact on what changes in the underlying data our eyes can 
percieve. The rainbow colour scale is still very common and notoriously bad - 
see e.g. [Borland & Taylor (2007)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4118486/),
[*The Rainbow Colour Map (repeatedly) considered harmful*](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/2017/08/23/the-rainbow-colour-map/),
and [*How The Rainbow Color Map Misleads*](https://eagereyes.org/basics/rainbow-color-map) - 
due to two huge problems that are fundamental to designing good colour scales: 
*Perceptual Uniformity* and *Colour Blind Safe*. Both of these issues have been
taken into account when designing the `scico` palettes, but let's tackle them
one by one:

### Colour blindness
Up to 10% of north european males have the most common type of colour blindness
(deuteranomaly, also known as red-green colour blindness), while the number is 
lower for other population groups. In addition, other, rarer, types of colour
blindness exists as well. In any case, the chance that a person with a color 
vision deficiency will look at your plots is pretty high.

As we have to assume that the plots we produce will be looked at by people with
color vision deficiency, we must make sure that the colours we use to encode 
data can be clearly read by them (ornamental colours are less important as 
they - hopefully - don't impact the conclusion of the graphic). Thanksfully 
there are ways to simulate how colours are percieved by people with various 
types of colour blindness. Let's look at the rainbow colour map:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pals)

pal.safe(rainbow, main = 'Rainbow scale')
```

As can be seen, there are huge areas of the scale where key tints disappears,
making it impossible to correctly map colours back to their original data 
values. Put this in contrast to one of the `scico` palettes:

```{r}
pal.safe(scico(100, palette = 'tokyo'), main = 'Tokyo scale')
```

While colour blindness certainly have an effect here, it is less detrimental as
changes along the scale can still be percieved and the same tint is not occuring
at multiple places.

### Perceptual uniformity
While lack of colour blind safety "only" affects a subgroup of your audience, 
lack of perceptual uniformity affects everyone - even you. Behind the slightly
highbrow name lies the criteria that equal jumps in the underlying data should
result in equal jumps in percieved colour difference. Said in another way, every
step along the palette should be percieved as giving the same amount of 
difference in colour.

One way to assess perceptual uniformity is by looking at small oscillations 
inside the scale. Let's return to our favourite worst rainbow scale:

```{r}
pal.sineramp(rainbow, main = 'Rainbow scale')
```

We can see that there are huge differences in how clearly the oscilations appear
along the scale and around the green area they even disappears. In comparison
the `scico` palettes produces much more even resuls:

```{r}
pal.sineramp(scico(100, palette = 'tokyo'), main = 'Tokyo scale')
```

### But wait - there's more!
This is just a very short overview into the world of colour perception and how 
it affects information visualisation. The `pals` package contains more functions
to assess the quality of colour palettes, some of which has been collected in
an ensemble function:

```{r}
pal.test(scico(100, palette = 'broc'), main = 'Broc scale')
```

It also has [a vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pals/vignettes/pals_examples.html) 
that explains in more detail how the different plots can be used to look into
different aspects of the palette.

`scico` is also not the only package that provides well-designed, safe, colour 
palettes. [`RColorBrewer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html)
has been a beloved utility for a long time, as well as the more recent 
[`viridis`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/index.html). Still,
choice is good and using the same palettes for prolonged time can make them seem
old and boring, so the more the merrier.

A last honerable mention is [the overview of palettes in R](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes/blob/master/README.md)
that [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://twitter.com/Emil_Hvitfeldt) has put together. Not
all of the palettes in it (the lions share actually) have been designed with the
issues discussed above in mind, but sometimes thats OK - at least you now know 
how to assess the impact of your choice and weigh it out with the other 
considerations you have.
