Screens is a generative series launcing on ArtBlocks Curated on January 31st, 
12:00p CT. This page will contain additional information and background about 
the project, after it has launched.

## Background
Screens is the continuation of an idea and vision that started with my 
Constructive series (released in August 2021). The primal aim was to explore the 
aesthetics offered by screen printing techniques, and this naturally led me to
explore the poster prints from both Bauhaus artists and Russian constructivism 
artists. Thus, while working on Constructive, the focal points where strong 
geometric compositions, strong simple colour palettes, gradients using a 
rendering technique mimicking screen printing.

Constructive was very much a handheld series. While it is generative in nature,
the macro composition was decided beforehand. I did enjoy the result immensely
and I knew almost immediately that I wanted to explore this aesthetic in a long
form format. Thus began the thought process that led to Screens.

With Screens I wanted to continue my main focus: Strong geometric shapes and 
gradients together with the signature grainy rendering style. However, the 
approach taken with Constructive wasn't scalable and besides, I didn't want to
rehash a finished project.

The idea of extruding lines into screen-like shapes and drawing them in an 
isometric view first came together with the idea of using flow fields to 
generate the lines. I very quickly cast aside the idea of flow fields for 
several reasons, one being overexposure to the concept, and one being a strong 
affection for pure geometric shapes in this project. The basic idea was born 
though, and could easily be used with other things than flow fields.

All of this happened without any coding or sketching at all. This is pretty much
on par with my process, as I often design and develop ideas purely in my head. 
Then, when I finally decided to sit down and code, the central part of the 
system was completed in 2 days, mainly because the result matched my vision so
well (this is not always the case). However, following this came several months
of trying out ideas and fine tuning the algorithm. In order for Screens to 
work as long form generative art I had to embrace a level of chaotic behaviour
that I would usually refrain from putting out there beyond my control. Thus, an
enormous amount of work was put into keeping the chaos in check so that I could
rest assured that every piece would work. Most of this work, and the months that
went into it, is obviously not visible since it was concerned with what 
shouldn't come up. If the work done is not apparent I have succeeded.
