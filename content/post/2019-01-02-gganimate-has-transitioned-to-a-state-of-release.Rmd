Just to start of the year in a positive way, I'm happy to announce that 
*gganimate* is now available on CRAN. This release is the result of a pretty 
focused development starting in the spring 2018 prior to my useR keynote about 
it.

## Some History
The *gganimate* package has been around for quite some time now with David 
Robinson making [the first commit](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/commit/81e5e95b33e90b0222314dd2ac187a749596dab0)
in early 2016. David's vision of gganimate revolved around the idea of 
frame-as-an-aesthetic and this easy-to-grasp idea gave it an early success. The 
version developed by David never made it to CRAN, and as part of ramping down 
his package development he asked me if I was interested in taking over 
maintenance. I was initially reluctant because I wanted a completely different
API, but he insisted that he supported a complete rewrite. The last version of
gganimate as maintained by David [is still available](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/releases/tag/v0.1.1) 
but I very quickly made some [drastic changes](https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/commit/ec82efbad04b9f19f125d9f3537bffbb202c38ac?diff=unified):

While this commit was done in the autumn 2017, nothing further happened until I
decided to make gganimate the center of my useR 2018 keynote, at which point I 
was forced (by myself) to have some sort of package ready by the summer of 2018.

A fair amount of users have shown displeasure in the breaking changes this 
history has resulted in. Many blog posts have already been written focusing on
the old API, as well as code on numerous computers that will no longer work. I
understand this frustration, of course, but both me and David agreed that doing
it this way was for the best in the end. I'm positive that the new API has 
already greatly exceeded the mind-share of the old API and given a year the old 
API will be all but a distant memory...

## The Grammar
Such drastic breaking changes were required because of a completely different
vision for how animation fitted into the grammar of graphics. Davids idea was 
that it was essentially a third dimension in the graphic and the animation was
simply flipping through slices along the third dimension in the same way as you
would look through the output of a CT scan. Me, on the other hand, wanted a 
grammar that existed in parallel to the grammar of graphics — not as part of it.

My useR keynote goes in to a lot of detail about my motivation and inspiration for
taking on this approach, and I'll not rehash it in this release post. Feel free
to take a 1h break from reading as you watch the talk

The gist of it all is that animations are a multifaceted beast and requires much
more than an additional aesthetic to be tamed. One of the cornerstones of the
talk is the separation of animations into scenes and segues. In short, a segue 
is an animated change in the underlying laws of the graphic (e.g. changes to 
coordinate systems, scales, mappings, etc.), whereas a scene is a change in 
the data on display. Scenes are concerned with *what* and segues are concerned 
with *how*. This separation is important for several reasons: It gives me a natural
focus area for the current version of gganimate (scenes), it serves as a
theoretical backbone to group animation operation, and it is a central limit in 
animation good practices: "You should never change *how* and *what* at the same 
time".

So, the version I'm presenting here is a grammar of animation uniquely focused
on *scenes*. This does not mean that I'll never look into segues, but they are
both much harder, and less important than getting a scene grammar to make sense,
so segues have to play second fiddle for now.

### What's in a scene
There are two main components to a scene: What we are looking at, and where we 
are looking from. The former is handled by *transitions* and *shadows*, whereas 
the latter is handled by *views*. In brief:

- **transitions** populates the frames of the animation with data, based on the
  data assigned to each layer. Several different transitions exists that 
  interpret the layer data differently.
- **shadows** gives memory to each frame by letting each frame include data from
  prior or future frames.
- **views** allow you to modify the range of the positional scales (zoom and 
  pan) either directly or as a function of the data assigned to the frame.

On top of these three main grammar components there is a range of functions to
modify how key parts of animations behave — for a general introduction to the 
ins and outs of the API, please see the 
[*Getting Started**](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html) guide.

## Grammar vs API
While it may appear that grammar and API are the same, this is not the case. A
grammar is a theoretical construct, a backbone from which an API can be defined.
Several APIs could implement the same grammar in multiple, incompatible, ways. 
For gganimate I have tried to align the API as much as possible with the ggplot2
API, so that the line between the two packages becomes blurred. You change a
plot to an animation by adding functions from gganimate to it, and the animation
is rendered when printing the animation object in the same way as ggplots are 
rendered when printing the object. An example of this is adding 
`transition_reveal()` to a plot to make it appear gradually along a numeric 
variable:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)

ggplot(airquality) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Day, y = Temp, group = Month))
```

```{r}
last_plot() + 
  transition_reveal(Day)
```

For the most part, the marriage between the ggplot2 and gganimate APIs is a happy
one, though it does show at points that the ggplot2 API was never designed with
animation in mind. I am particularly pleased with how powerful the API has 
turned out, and I have already seen countless uses I had never anticipated.

## Making Fireworks
While a proper introduction to its use is better kept for a separate document 
(such as the *Getting Started* guide mentioned earlier), I think I would do
gganimate a disservice by not showing of at least a single fully fledged 
example. Below is the code needed to make fireworks with gganimate:

```{r}
# Firework colours
colours <- c(
  'lawngreen',
  'gold',
  'white',
  'orchid',
  'royalblue',
  'yellow',
  'orange'
)
# Produce data for a single blast
blast <- function(n, radius, x0, y0, time) {
  u <- runif(n, -1, 1)
  rho <- runif(n, 0, 2*pi)
  x <- radius * sqrt(1 - u^2) * cos(rho) + x0
  y <- radius * sqrt(1 - u^2) * sin(rho) + y0
  id <- sample(.Machine$integer.max, n + 1)
  data.frame(
    x = c(x0, rep(x0, n), x0, x),
    y = c(0, rep(y0, n), y0, y),
    id = rep(id, 2),
    time = c((time - y0) * runif(1), rep(time, n), time, time + radius + rnorm(n)),
    colour = c('white', rep(sample(colours, 1), n), 'white', rep(sample(colours, 1), n)),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
}
# Make 20 blasts
n <- round(rnorm(20, 30, 4))
radius <- round(n + sqrt(n))
x0 <- runif(20, -30, 30)
y0 <- runif(20, 40, 80)
time <- runif(20, max = 100)
fireworks <- Map(blast, n = n, radius = radius, x0 = x0, y0 = y0, time = time)
fireworks <- dplyr::bind_rows(fireworks)
```

All of the above is just data preparation. `blast()` simply creates segments 
from the center of the blast and out to the periphery, sampling colours from the
`colour` vector. The end result, if plotted statically, looks like this:

```{r}
ggplot(fireworks) + 
  geom_path(aes(x = x, y = y, group = id, colour = colour)) + 
  scale_colour_identity()
```

Now, to make it all move, as well as style it a bit for a better effect

```{r, gganimate=list(detail = 10), dev.args=list(bg='black')}
ggplot(fireworks) + 
  geom_point(aes(x, y, colour = colour, group = id), size = 0.5, shape = 20) + 
  scale_colour_identity() + 
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-65, 65), expand = FALSE, clip = 'off') +
  theme_void() + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'black', colour = NA), 
        panel.border = element_blank()) + 
  # Here comes the gganimate code
  transition_components(time, exit_length = 20) + 
  ease_aes(x = 'sine-out', y = 'sine-out') + 
  shadow_wake(0.05, size = 3, alpha = TRUE, wrap = FALSE, 
              falloff = 'sine-in', exclude_phase = 'enter') + 
  exit_recolour(colour = 'black')
```

While I wont go into detail, `transition_component()` allow all the points to 
follow their own trajectory and timeline independently, `ease_aes()` ensures 
that the velocity of the points taper off, `shadow_wake()` is responsible for
the trail after each point, and `exit_recolour()` makes sure the points 
gradually fades into the black background once they "burn out".

## The Future
While this release is a milestone for gganimate, it is not a signal of it *being 
done* as many things are still missing (even if we ignore the whole segue part 
of the grammar). It does signal a commitment to stability from now on, though so
you should feel confident in using this package without fearing that your code 
will break in the future. You can follow the state of the package at its 
website, <www.gganimate.com>, where I'll also try to add additional guides and
tutorials with time. If you create something with gganimate please share it on
twitter, as I'm eager to see what people will make of it.

I'll do a sort-of live cookbook talk on gganimate at this years RStudio conf in
Austin, so if you are there and interested to learn more about the package do
swing by.

Now, Go Animate!
