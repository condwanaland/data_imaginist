I'm a bioinformatician/computational biologist turned data scientist who focuses 
on improving researchers interactions with the data they produce. I develop 
visualizations, frameworks and GUI's as well as related tools (mostly in R). I'm 
currently employed by [SKAT](http://www.skat.dk) as a data scientist.

I'm on twitter ([@thomasp85](https://twitter.com/thomasp85)) and 
[GitHub](https://github.com/thomasp85) mainly, though you can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasp85). My posts about R are published 
on [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) together with a lot of other 
amazing R related content.

If you use some of the tools I develop and want to ensure that I can continue
doing what I do, you can support me through 
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/thomasp85) or by donating directly 
[through Paypal](https://paypal.me/thomasp85) â€” Any amount is appreciated.

If you need help with an R-related project and think I'd be a good fit, you can
contact me on Twitter, or by mail (<thomasp85@gmail.com>). I cannot promise that
I can make time for it, but if the project is interesting enough I'll do my 
best.

## Art Commision
