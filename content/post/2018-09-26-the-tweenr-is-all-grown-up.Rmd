> NOTE: tweenr was released some time ago but a theft of my computer while 
writing the release post meant that I only just finished writing about it now.

I'm very happy to once again announce a package update, as a new major version 
of `tweenr` is now on CRAN. This release, while significant in itself, is also
an important part of getting `gganimate` on CRAN, so if you care about 
`gganimate` but have never heard of `tweenr` you should be happy nonetheless.

`tweenr` was my first sort-of popular package and filled a gap in the gganimate 
version of yore, where smooth transitions were something you had to bring 
yourself. It has lived almost unchanged since its initial release, but as I 
began to develop the next iteration of `gganimate` it became clear that new 
functionality was needed. Some of it ended up in the 
[`transformr`](https://github.com/thomasp85/transformr) but a huge chunk has 
been added to tweenr itself. A description of everything new follows below.

## Something new, something old {new_old}
The main API of the previous version of `tweenr` comprised of the 
`tween_states()`, `tween_elements()`, and `tween_appear()`. All of these needed
serious change in both capabilities and API to the extend that all prior code
would break, so instead I decided to keep the old functions unchanged and create
new ones for a brighter future.

### tween_states ⇒ tween_state/keep_state
`tween_states()` was perhaps the most used of the old functions. It takes a list
of data.frames and a specification of how long transitions between them should
take and how long it should pause at each data.frame. This is perfect for 
situations where you have discrete states and want to have a smooth transition
between them. Still it had certain shortcomings, such as requiring that each 
data.frame included the same number of rows etc. (meaning that each "element"
should be present in each state). Further I have ended up finding it a bit 
clumsy to use. The new function(s) that should serve the same needs as 
`tween_states()` is `tween_state()` (and `keep_state()`) and they are much more
powerful. The biggest difference, perhaps, is that `tween_state()` only takes a
*from* and *to* state and not an arbitrarily long list of states. If transitions
are needed between more states you'll need to chain calls together (potentially
with `keep_state()` if the state should pause between transitions). It will 
something like this:

```{r}
library(tweenr)
irises <- split(iris, iris$Species)
iris_tween <- irises$setosa %>% 
  tween_state(irises$versicolor, ease = 'cubic-in-out', nframes = 10) %>% 
  keep_state(5) %>% 
  tween_state(irises$virginica, ease = 'linear', nframes = 15) %>% 
  keep_state(5)
```

As can be seen, if you like piping you'll feel right at home. Apart from the
seemingly superficial change in API, the `tween_state()` also packs some new 
tricks. One of these is per-column easing, so you can specify different easing
functions for different variables. Another, more fundamental one, is the 
possibility of specifying an id to match rows by. Ultimately this means that 
rows no longer needs to be matched by position and that you can now tween 
between states with different numbers of elements. All of this is so important 
that it will get its own section later on in [Enter and Exit](#enter-and-exit).

### tween_elements ⇒ tween_components
While `tween_states()` was probably the most used of the legacy functions it was
by no means the only one. `tween_elements()` was a very powerful function that
let you specify different individual states for each element in a single 
data.frame and then expand this to an arbitrary number of frames. The changes 
that its hier bring is less dramatic than what happened with `tween_states()`,
and simply adds the same features that `tween_state()` introduced. This means
per-column easing and the same features as described below in 
[Enter and Exit](#enter-and-exit). Further it changes the semantics of a couple of
variables so they are now tidy evaluated. This means that state specifications
can be calculated on the fly, rather than having to exist inside the data.frame
to be tweened.

### tween_appear ⇒ tween_events
`tween_appear()` never really felt right. The purpose was to let each row appear
in a specific frame while still allowing the user to define how it should 
appear. To this end it expanded the data.frame by giving each row an *age* in 
each frame (negative age meant that it had yet to appear) and then let the user
do with this as they pleased. What was missing was the whole idea of 
[Enter and Exit](#enter-and-exit) which I have already plugged multiple times. 
`tween_event()` is a pretty radical change in order to solve the problem that 
`tween_appear()` originally tried (but failed) to solve.

## Enter and Exit
Before we go any further with other new tweening functions I think I owe it to
you to describe what all this entering and exiting I've been talking about 
really is. If you have dabbled in D3.js the two words will be familiar but they
have slightly different meaning in `tweenr`. In D3 enter and exit describe a
selection of data that did not match in a data join between current and next 
state, while in tweenr it is a function that modifies data that is going to 
appear or disappear. If enter and/or exit is not given, the data will just pop
into existence in the first frame it relates to and disappear without a trace 
after the last frame it relates to has ended. if you provide e.g. an enter 
function this will be applied to all elements when they first appear. The result
of the function will then be inserted into the tweening prior to the original 
data so that any changes the function does will gradually change to the original
data. This may sound quite confusing, but in essence it means that if you pass 
in an enter function that sets the transparancy variable to zero you'll get a
gradual fade-in effect. The exit function is just like it, but in reverse. But 
let's see it in effect instead:

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 2, alpha = 1) # 2 rows
df2 <- data.frame(x = 2:0, y = 1, alpha = 1) # 3 rows

fade <- function(data) {
  data$alpha <- 0
  data
}

tween <- tween_state(df1, df2, ease = 'linear', nframes = 5, enter = fade)

tween$alpha[tween$.id == 3]
```

We can see that the alpha value of the third element (the one that doesn't exist
in the first state) gradually increase from zero to one. The reason why 0 isn't
included is that the enter and exit function return virtual states that doens't 
remain in the data - only the transition to and from them does.

## New tweens on the block
Appart from the new versions of the old functionality discussed [above](#new_old)
this version also includes some brand new tweens, mainly implemented to serve
needs in `gganimate` but of course also available for everyone else.

### tween_along
This is the tweening function that powers `transition_reveal()` in `gganimate` -
if you have played with that you are fairly well situated to understand what it 
does. In essence it allows you to specify time points for the different rows in
your data.frame and then tween between these. You might think that this is 
exactly what `tween_components()` does and you'd partly be right. The big 
difference is that `tween_along()` ensures equidistant frames, whereas 
`tween_components()` assigns all rows in the data to the nearest frame and then
use the frame as a time variable. The latter will always have the raw data 
appearing in one frame or another while the former will not. Further, 
`tween_along()` will optionally keep earlier rows in your data at each frame, 
which is useful if you e.g. want a line to gradually appear along an axis.

### tween_at
This is a pretty low level tweening function intened to get an exact state 
between two data frames or vectors. It takes two states and a numeric vector 
giving the tween position for each row and then calculates the intermediary 
rows.

```{r}
tween_at(mtcars[1:3, ], mtcars[4:6, ], runif(3), 'linear')
```

This is unlikely to be useful for directly creating animations (though I guess 
it is low-level enough to be able to be shoehorned into anything). It is being 
used in `gganimate` for calculating shadow falloff in `shadow_wake()`.

### tween_fill
This tween takes a page out of `tidyr::fill` and simply fill out missing 
elements in a data frame or vector. Instead of being boring and repeating the
prior or following data it doesn the `tweenr` thing and tweens between them:

```{r}
mtcars2 <- mtcars[1:7, ]
mtcars2[2:6, ] <- NA

tween_fill(mtcars2, 'cubic-in-out')
```

Neat-o...

## Grab bag of niceties
There are more subtle additions to `tweenr` as well, most of which has also been
driven by `gganimate` needs. Here's an unceremonious list:

- *More information:* In olden days `tweenr` simply added a `.frame` column to 
the output to identify the frame the row belonged to. It still does, but that 
column is now accompagnied by a `.phase` column that tells if the data is raw, 
static, entering, exiting, or transitioning, and an `.id` column that identifies
the same data across frames.
- *More support:* The supported data types has been expanded considerably. Most
notably list columns are now accepted. If the list only contains numeric vectors
these vectors will get tweened accordingly, and if not the list will be treated
as constant.
- *Better colour support:* Colour has always been tweened in the LAB 
representation to get a more natural transition. In the old version the native
`convertColor()` function was used, but this could lead to substantial slowdown
when tweening lots of data. To address this `farver` was developed and released
and this version of `tweenr` naturally uses this for colour space conversions 
now. In addition, `tweenr` now supports hex-colours with alpha.

I think that is it, but frankly there has been so many additions that I may have 
missed a few... First to find something I missed gets a sticker!
