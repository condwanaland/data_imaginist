Hi!

My name is Thomas Lin Pedersen. I'm a software engineer from Denmark having a blast developing open source tools (mainly for [R](https://cran.r-project.org)) together with my colleagues in the Tidyverse team at [Posit, PBC](https://posit.co).

My main focus is developing tools for data visualization and I'm responsible for most of the R graphic stack, from high-level tools such as ggplot2 and patchwork and all the way down to the nitty-gritty lower level with font rendering and graphics devices such as ragg and textshaping. If you've made graphics in R, my code has probably been involved at some point.

On the side I'm an avid generative artist that uses code and randomness to create intricate pieces. My art has been exhibited in Venice, London, and New York among other places.
