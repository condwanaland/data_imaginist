I'm happy to announce that farver 2.0 has landed on CRAN. This is a big release
comprising of a rewrite of much of the internals along with a range of new 
functions and improvements. Read on to find out what this is all about.

## The case for farver
The first version of farver really came out of necessity as I identified a major
performance bottleneck in gganimate related to converting colours into Lab 
colour space and back when tweening them. This was a result of 
`grDevices::convertColor()` not being meant for use with millions of colour 
values. I build farver in order to address this very specific need, which in 
turn mad Brodie Gaslam look into speeding up the grDevices function. The 
bottom line is that, while farver is still the fastest at converting between
colour spaces, grDevices is now so fast that I probably wouldn't have bothered
to build farver in the first place had it been like this all along. I find this
a prime example of fruitful open source competition and couldn't be happier that
Brodie took it upon him.

So why a new shiny version? As part of removing compiled code from scales, we 
decided to adopt farver for colour interpolation, and the code could use a 
brush-up. I've become much more trained in writing compiled code, and further 
there were some shortcomings in the original implementation that needed to be 
addressed if scales (and thus ggplot2) should depend on it. Further, I usually
write on larger frameworks and there is a certain joy in picking a niche area 
that you care about and go ridiculously overboard in tooling without worrying
about if it benefits any other than yourself (ambient is another example of such 
indulgence).

## The new old
The former version of farver was quite limited in functionality. It had two
functions: `convert_colour()` and `compare_colour()` that did colour space 
conversion and colour distance calculations respectively. No outward changes
has been made to these functions, but internally a lot has happened. The old 
versions had no input validation, so passing in colours with `NA`, `NaN`, `Inf`,
and `-Inf` would give you some truly weird results back. Further, the input and
output was not capped to the range of the given colour space, so you could in
theory end up with negative RGB values if you converted from a colour space with
a larger gamut than sRGB. Both of these issues has been rectified in the new
version. Any non-finite value in any channel will result in `NA` in all channels
in the output (for conversion) or an `NA` distance (for comparison). 

```{r}
library(farver)
colours <- cbind(r = c(0, NA, 255), g = c(55, 165, 20), b = c(-Inf, 120, 200))
colours
```

```{r}
convert_colour(colours, from = 'rgb', to = 'yxy')
```

Further, input is now capped to the channel range (if any) before conversion, 
and output is capped again before returning the result. The later means that 
`convert_colour()` is only symmetric (ignoring rounding errors) if the colours 
are within gamut in both colour spaces.

```{r}
# Equal output because values are capped between 0 and 255
colours <- cbind(r = c(1000, 255), g = 55, b = 120)
convert_colour(colours, 'rgb', 'lab')
```

Lastly, a new colour space has been added: CIELch(uv) (in farver `hcl`) has been
added as a cousin of CIELch(ab) (`lch`). Both are polar transformations, but the
former is based on `luv` values and the latter on `lab`. Both colour spaces are
used interchangeably (though not equivalent), and as the `grDevices::hcl()` 
function is based on the `luv` space it made sense to provide an equivalent in 
farver.

## The new new
The new functionality mainly revolves around the encoding of colour in text 
strings. In many programming languages colour can be encoded into strings as 
`#RRGGBB` where each channel is given in hexadecimal digits. This is also how
colours are passed around in R mostly (R also has a list of recognized colour 
names that can be given as aliases instead of the hex string - see 
`grDevices::colour()` for a list). The encoding is convenient as it allows 
colours to be encoded into vectors, and thus into data frame columns or arrays,
but means that if you need to perform operations on it you'd have to first 
decode the string into channels, potentially convert it into the required colour
space, do the manipulation, convert back to sRGB, and encode it into strings. 
Encoding and decoding has been supported in grDevices with `rgb()` and 
`col2rgb()` respectively, both of which are pretty fast. `col2rgb()` has a quirk
in that the output has the channels in the rows instead of the columns, contrary
to how decoded colours are presented everywhere else:

```{r}
grDevices::col2rgb(c('#56fec2', 'red'))
```


farver sports two new functions that, besides providing consistency in the 
output format also eliminates some steps in the workflow described above:

```{r}
# Decode strings with decode_colour
colours <- decode_colour(c('#56fec2', 'red'))
colours
```

```{r}
# Encode with encode_colour
encode_colour(colours)
```

Besides the basic use shown above, both function allows input/output from other
colour spaces than sRGB. That means that if you need to manipulate some colour in
Lab space, you can simply decode directly into that, do the manipulation and 
encode directly back. The functionality is baked into the compiled code, meaning
that a lot of memory allocation is spared, making this substantially faster than
a grDevices-based workflow:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Create some random colour strings
colour_strings <- sample(grDevices::colours(), 5000, replace = TRUE)

# Get Lab values from a string
timing <- bench::mark(
  farver = decode_colour(colour_strings, to = 'lab'),
  grDevices = convertColor(t(col2rgb(colour_strings)), 'sRGB', 'Lab', scale.in = 255), 
  check = FALSE,
  min_iterations = 100
)
plot(timing, type = 'ridge') +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

Can we do better than this? If the purpose is simply to manipulate a single 
channel in a colour encoded as a string, we may forego the encoding and decoding 
completely and do it all in compiled code. farver provides a family of functions
for doing channel manipulation in string encoded colours. The channels can be 
any channel in any colour space supported by farver, and the decoding, 
manipulation and encoding is done in one pass. If you have a lot of colours and
need to increase e.g. darkness, this can save a lot of memory allocation:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# a lot of colours
colour_strings <- sample(grDevices::colours(), 500000, replace = TRUE)

darken <- function(colour, by) {
  colour <- t(col2rgb(colour))
  colour <- convertColor(colour, from = 'sRGB', 'Lab', scale.in = 255)
  colour[, 'L'] <- colour[, 'L'] * by
  colour <- convertColor(colour, from = 'Lab', to = 'sRGB')
  rgb(colour)
}
timing <- bench::mark(
  farver = multiply_channel(colour_strings, channel = 'l', value = 1.2, space = 'lab'),
  grDevices = darken(colour_strings, 1.2),
  check = FALSE,
  min_iterations = 100
)
plot(timing, type = 'ridge') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

## The bottom line
The new release of farver provides invisible improvements to the existing 
functions and a range of new functionality for working efficiently with string 
encoded colours. You will be using it indirectly following the next release of
scales if you are plotting with ggplot2, but you shouldn't be able to tell. If
you somehow ends up having to manipulate millions of colours, then farver is
still the king of the hill by a large margin when it comes to performance, but 
I personally believe that it also provides a much cleaner API than any of the 
alternatives.
